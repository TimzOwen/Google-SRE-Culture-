## Site Reliability Engineering 
#### SRE & DevOPs

__DevOPs__ is a combination on **Developers** + __Operators__

#### Functions of DevOPss

1. Reduce Organization's Silos

2. Accept Failure (Blamelessness)

3. Implement Gradual Change (Deployment velocity)

4. Leverage tooling and automation (Toil automation)

5. Measure everything (measure Toil and Reliability)

__SRE__ :

    The pratice of balacing between velocity of deployment and Reliability Risk

    plays a Role and Practice to maintain and make sure services are running and meeting customer's needs
    Focus on practices  and technical and practical traditions

### Service Level Objective (SLO)

#### Value of SRE:

__Mission SRE__: To protect,provide for,and progress s/w and systems with consistent focus on availability,
                latency, perfomance and capacity

#### Accepting Failures as normal with blameless postmoterms 

Be comfortabe with __Failures__

Eliminate ambiguity in __monitoring__

Establish and document __process__



#### Components of Postmoterm:

__Details__ of the incident and timeline

The __Actions taken to mitigate__ or __resolve__ the issue/incident

The incident's __impact__

its __trigger and root cause__ or causes 

The __follow up actions__ to prevent it's reoccurence

__Postmoterm__ ensures that al __root causes are understood__ by the team

Reduces likelihood for stressful outages

avoid multuplying complexity

Learn from mistakes and those from others

#### Blamelessness and Psychological safety

__Psychological safety__: Beleif that a person will not be punished/humuliated for
    speaking up with ideas, concerns or mistakes

#### Building psychological safety:

    1. Frame work as learning Problem and not an execution problem
    2. Acknowldge your own fallibility
    3. Model curiosity

#### impacts of psychological safety: (on Leadtime,deployment frequency & time to restore)

    Cooperation is high
    Bridging is encouraged
    Messengers are no punished when delivering bad news
    Failure is treated as opportunity for improvement
    New ideas are welcomed

#### BLAMELESSNESS

This is a behaviour that __fosters__ psychological safety

__Why people blame: 

    Hindsight bias (Tendency of overestimating one's abilit to predicted/unpredicted outcome)
    discomfort discharge (when people blame others to discharge discomfort at a neighboring level)
 
 __Focus on systems and Processes __not__ People__

 Innovations require some risk taking
